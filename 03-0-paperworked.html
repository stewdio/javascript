				<h1>Paperworked</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>Friday, 21 September 2012</strong>.
					After touching base with several of you throughout the week 
					I felt it was important to extend this assignment’s deadline until next class
					and to also hold a workshop session today.
					(This will bump back the design and prototypal inheritance discussion I intended to have today.)
					We’ll begin class by looking at Skip.js, 
					which I was saving for the prototype discussion but I believe the time functions will be useful to you for your Paperwork.
					Then I’ll go over the homework assignment due by email next <strong>Thursday—24
					hours before class</strong>—completing your Paper animations.
				</p>
				<p>
					After that it’s workshop time.
					Be sure to ask questions and generally take advantage of all of us being in the same room.
					I’ll point out interesting responses to the assignment and also assist you individually. 
				</p>
