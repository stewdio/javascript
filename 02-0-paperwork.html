				<h1>Paperwork</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>Friday, 14 September 2012</strong>.
					Today I’ll introduce you to <a target="_blank" href="http://paperjs.org">Paper.js</a>, 
					a javascript framework for creating HTML5 drawings and animations.
					The first half of today’s class will be a lecture on a few more “JavaScript basics” and a look at something more advanced, 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)">closures</a>, one of the magical aspects of JavaScript.
				</p>
				<p>
					After the break we’ll look at your Square Variations homework from last week,
					then dive into Paper. You’ll find the two are related.
					(I’ve pushed back our look at 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming">prototypal inheritance</a>
					until next week so we can 
					so we can spend more time playing with Paper together.)
					Finally, we’ll discuss your next homework assignment.
				</p>
